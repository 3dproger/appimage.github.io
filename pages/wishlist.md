As many excellent apps you will find here, as many people probably miss their personal favorite. This is just a collection of applications for with the respective authors provide an AppImage for Linux.

# For users
We do not develop AppImages. We simply add them to this directory of available AppImages. So if you would like an AppImage to be made for your favorite application, please ask the project that makes the application to provide an AppImage. Once that becomes available, we can add it to this catalog.

# For application developers

Please see [https://docs.appimage.org/](https://docs.appimage.org/) for how to generate and upload an AppImage.

Once your AppImage is available for download, please [file an issue at GitHub](https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageHub/issues/new) to get it added to have it tested and added to the list.
