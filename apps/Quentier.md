    C: Note taking app integrated with Evernote
  Description:
    C: "<p>Quentier is a cross-platform note taking app capable of working as Evernote client.\n            It can also be used
      for local note taking as well, without the necessity to even have\n            the Evernote account.\n\n\t    Quentier
      supports the following features:\n             * Synchronization of user data (notebooks, notes, tags, saved searches)
      with Evernote servers\n\t     * Evernote search syntax can be used for data searching within the local database\n\t     *
      Printing of notes and converting them to pdf files\n             * Ability to open several notes simultaneously in either
      tabbed or windowed interface\n\t     * Ability to switch between accounts - both local and Evernote ones</p>"
